# Auto-Evaluation-using-C-
A C++ based system that uses KMP String Algorithm, Hashing and Chaining for the evaluation of subjective, objective and multiple correct objective answers respectively.

It uses the file system to display questions and retrieve words for subjective answers. The KMP String algorithm is further used to detect the presence and count the frequency of
the words.

Hashing has been used to evaluate the single correct objective questions while Chaining has been used to evaluate multiple correct objective questions and their options.
